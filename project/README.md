# Project 3
All files were either replicated from the previous lab as well as the example
demos given for this lab.
Continuing the improvement of this toy, we now upgrade it to be displaying
something within the screen.
Unfourtantley I was not able to complete the dynamic movement suggested within
the requirements but each button activates a different drawn image.

#Functionality
Make the load in the main repo, followed by the make found within the Project
folder, and finally also make the one found in the BlinkBuzz folder.
After this simply run "make load".

#Bugs
My screen flickers with every chagne of the button presses, either A it
flickers slowly or flickers incredibly fast when pressed on button 4 for
example, this is caused by  me not moving the timer times to accomidate for
the LED display, probably moving it to a seperate method or modifying the
clock with exceptions can help make a cleaner image.
